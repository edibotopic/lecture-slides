## Using these slides
<html>
<section>
All slides on this page are versions of those used in my lectures on youtube. They have been optimised for web and mobile use, which mainly involves replacing videos with images. It is possible to include videos but the site would eventually become quite slow, and the videos are on youtube anyway. The voiceovers and live drawings from my lectures are also not included. Navigating the slides is fairly straightforward, and you can move forwards and backwards using arrow keys (computer) or swiping (phone/tablet). I have included some additional instructions below:
  
<p><b>📺Full screen</b>: press the <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">F</mark> key</p>
<p><b>🎮View video controls</b>: hover cursor over video</p>
<p><b>🔎Zoom in</b>: press <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">alt+leftmousebutton</mark></p>
<p><b>👨‍🎨👩‍🎨Draw</b>: press <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">C</mark> to toggle pen for drawing</p>
<p><b>🌈Pen colour</b>: press <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">X</mark> to cycle and 
<mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">Y</mark> to revert</p>

<p><b>:printer: Printing</b>: these slides were not meant for printing but if you insist you can right click and select print, which will render the slides as plain html (basic but fine). If for some reason you want a printout that is formatted like the slides  you will need to mess with the url by changing a few characters at the end of the url; for example, changing https://edibotopic.github.io/lecture-slides/FS3020_pro_frac.html#/1 to https://edibotopic.github.io/lecture-slides/FS3020_pro_frac.html?print-pdf will render a pdf that looks more or less the same as the slides.
