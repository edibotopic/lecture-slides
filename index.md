## Using these slides
All slides on this page are basic versions of those used in my lectures on youtube. They have been optimised for web and mobile use, which mainly involves replacing high-res videos with low-res images. It is possible to include videos but the site would eventually become quite slow, and the videos are up on youtube anyway. To hear me talk and draw through the lectures you will need to go to the corresponding youtube video, a link to which is included within each set of slides. Navigating the slides is fairly straightforward, you just move forwards and backwards with arrow keys (computer) or by swiping (phone/tablet). I have included some additional instructions below:  
  
📺**Full screen**: press the <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">F</mark> key  
~~🎮**View video controls**: hover cursor over video~~  
🔎**Zoom in**: press <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">alt+leftmousebutton</mark>  
👨‍🎨👩‍🎨**Draw on slides**: press <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">C</mark> to toggle pen for drawing  
🌈**Pen colour**: press <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">X</mark> to cycle and 
<mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">Y</mark> to revert 

:printer: **Printing**: these slides were not meant for printing but if you insist you can right click and select print, which will render the slides as plain html (basic but fine). If for some reason you want a printout that is formatted like the slides you will need to mess with the url by changing a few characters at the end of the url; for example, changing https://edibotopic.github.io/lecture-slides/FS3020_pro_frac.html#/1 to https://edibotopic.github.io/lecture-slides/FS3020_pro_frac.html?print-pdf will render a pdf that looks more or less the same as the slides. Note: your drawings will not be included in the printout.
