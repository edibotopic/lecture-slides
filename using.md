title: using the slides
---

All slides on this page are ***basic versions of full lectures*** found on youtube. They have been optimised for web and mobile use, which typically involves compressing videos into low-res formats. ***Longer videos may be replaced*** by links or images to prevent slowdown of the site. If you want the ***audio and drawings*** that accompany the lectures you must go to the relevant youtube video - you will find clickable and scannable links in the slides. Navigating the slides is easy, you just move forwards and backwards with horizontal arrow keys (computer) or by swiping (phone/tablet). Slides can also be navigated vertically but I rarely use this function. I have mostly tested the slides on Chrome and Firefox; if you use a less common browser (Internet Explorer, Safari, Edge, etc.) and encounter issues please let me know so I can try to fix them. See additional instructions below:  
  
📺**Full screen** (recommended): press the <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">F</mark> key.  

🎮**View video controls**: hover cursor over video. If you still don't see the controls <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">right click</mark> and select 'show controls' in the popup menu. 
<!-- 🔎**Zoom in**: press <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">alt+leftmousebutton</mark>   -->

👨‍🎨👩‍🎨**Draw on slides**: press <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">C</mark> to toggle pen for drawing or press the blue icon at the bottom left of the screen. The simplest way to capture your drawings is to take a screenshot on your computer, phone or tablet. 

🌈**Pen colour**: press <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">X</mark> to cycle through colours and <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">Y</mark> to cycle back. If you want to capture any drawings you make just use the **Print Screen** function on your keyboard with the slide open in full screen and paste it into whatever image editing software you use (e.g., Powerpoint, Paint, Inkscape).

:printer: **Printing**: these slides were not designed for printing but if you insist you can <mark style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153);outline-color: white;outline-style: solid;">right click</mark> and select 'print' or 'save as pdf' as needed, which will render the slides as ***plain html***. If you want a printout that is formatted like the slides you will need to change a few characters at the end of the url; for example, changing https://edibotopic.github.io/lecture-slides/FS3020_pro_frac.html#/1 to https://edibotopic.github.io/lecture-slides/FS3020_pro_frac.html?print-pdf will render a pdf that looks more or less the same as the slides.

:phone: the slides should work well on your phone or tablet, although there may be a little less functionality. If any images or videos don't show well try to switch your device between portrait and landcape view. I have tested this on android and it worked well.
